With half a dozen candidates already in the race and dozens more considering it, Democrats will have no shortage of candidates auditioning for the role of Trump-slayer.</p>

            <p>When the massive field is finalized, likely before the first debate in June 2019, the potential candidates could stretch four decades, feature a historic number of women and include multiple African Americans, at least one Latino, a Hindu – and a vegan. Among them are political veterans – senators, members of congress, governors, small and big-town mayors – as well as political novices – businessmen, entrepreneurs and a even New Age author – who span the ideological spectrum from consensus minded-pragmatists to Democratic socialists.</p>

            <p>A few candidates have already declared candidacy like Julián Castro and Tulsi Gabbard while some like Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand are taking the preliminary step of forming an exploratory committee. </p>
